# Mystic Tiger Ink - Chinese Traditional Tattoo Studio Website

Welcome to "Mystic Tiger Ink," a conceptual website for an imagined Chinese traditional tattoo studio. This project represents my initial foray into using Laravel, one of the most popular PHP web application frameworks, and my first experience integrating a Bootstrap template. Developed as part of a school project, it serves as a testament to my learning journey in web development.

## About the Project

"Mystic Tiger Ink" is designed to simulate a static website for a boutique tattoo studio specializing in Chinese traditional art. The site is built with Laravel to explore the framework's capabilities in routing, views, and static content management, combined with a Bootstrap template to ensure a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.

## Features

- **Static Content Pages:** Explore the studio's story, artist profiles, and gallery showcasing signature tattoo designs.
- **Bootstrap Integration:** Utilizes a Bootstrap template for a mobile-friendly and visually engaging user interface.
- **Laravel Framework:** My first project using Laravel, focusing on its structure and core features without a database integration.
